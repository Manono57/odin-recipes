            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Everyone should know how to cook rice. Most cuisines of the world are cooking rice in one way or another<br> 
                We're also drinking our fair share of rice — in sake, horchata, rice milk, and even beer.<br>
                All told, we humans get more than 20 percent of our calories from this small but mighty grain.
